# cli TS-code organizer

This project should become a cli-version of amazing [TypeScript Class Organizer for VS Code](https://github.com/aljazsim/vs-code-typescript-class-organizer). So thanks to @aljazsim

The `vs-code-typescript-class-organizer` is just reduced version of `https://github.com/aljazsim/vs-code-typescript-class-organizer` source code (with all vs-code removed stuff).
